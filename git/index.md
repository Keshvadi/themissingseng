## What is git

Git is a system used for version control to help you track the changes made to your files and collaborate with other developers. It also allows you to save snapshots of your work so you can go back to look at or restore previous versions.

## Why would we use Git

Imagine you have a project and you made a change that broke everything... **oops**. This is where git can help. Git will allow you to save multiple versions of your code that you can then import back into your project and continue working from, kind of like a checkpoint in a game. Imagine a scenario where you would like to collaborate with a friend on a project, instead of emailing each other the code or sharing a flash drive, you create a GitHub repo for you and your partner, allowing you to work together on the project from anywhere!

## Why should I care?

Git is an industry standard, all employers will be utilizing Git in the work place. Getting ahead of the curve and pushing your projects to GitHub is a great indication of where you are at with programming, acting as a portfolio that employers can look at. On top of being an industry standard, Git is just convienient to use in general. It allows you to collaborate with others and store snapshots of your programs in case you mess up and need to go back to an onld working version.
