## What is git

Git is a system used for version control to help you track the changes made to your files and collaborate with other developers. It also allows you to save snapshots of your work so you can go back to look at or restore previous versions.

## Why Would we use Git

Imagine you are working on a project and you made a change that caused a lot of problems down the line for you. Git organizes your workflow, allowing you to save multiple versions of your files and seamlessly collaborate with others. Git is one of the most widely used software development tools and can be applied to any project that involves files.
